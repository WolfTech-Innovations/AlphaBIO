**AlphaBIO: DNA Sequence Binding for Target DNA Disarmament**

AlphaBIO is a bioinformatics tool designed to generate DNA sequences capable of binding to and breaking down target DNA sequences. The tool simulates DNA binding affinity, stability, and the effectiveness of custom-designed DNA sequences intended to neutralize harmful target DNAs such as viruses or other genetic threats.

Key Features:
- **DNA Sequence Analysis**: Analyze GC content, melting temperature, and stability of DNA sequences to predict their effectiveness in binding to targets.
- **Binding Affinity Calculation**: Assess the strength and stability of DNA binding interactions with target sequences.
- **Cure Candidate Generation**: Automatically generate potential DNA sequences capable of binding to the target DNA, with effectiveness evaluations based on stability and binding scores.
- **Hairpin and Repeat Detection**: Identify and evaluate secondary structures like hairpins and repeats that may affect the DNAâ€™s ability to bind.
- **Optimization**: Optimize cure candidates for stability and effectiveness, ensuring maximum efficiency in neutralizing target DNA.

AlphaBIO aims to provide tools for molecular biologists and genetic engineers to design DNA sequences that can disarm harmful genetic material, making it particularly useful in fields like virology, synthetic biology, and gene editing.
