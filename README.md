## AlphaBIO 2.1.3 - DNA/RNA Manipulation Suite

**AlphaBIO 2.1.3** is a powerful DNA/RNA manipulation tool developed by **WolfTech Innovations**. It provides a terminal-based interface (TUI) for a range of bioinformatics tasks, from basic sequence transcription and mutation to advanced sequence analysis and random sequence generation. With easy-to-use functions for both DNA and RNA sequences, AlphaBIO offers various tools for sequence analysis, mutation introduction, GC content calculation, and more.

### Features:
- **DNA/RNA Transcription**: Transcribe DNA sequences to RNA and vice versa.
- **Mutation Introduction**: Perform point mutations, insertions, and deletions on sequences with customizable probabilities.
- **GC Content Calculation**: Analyze the GC content percentage of a given sequence.
- **Sequence Alignment**: Compare two sequences and highlight matching and mismatching base pairs.
- **Reverse Complement**: Generate reverse complement sequences for DNA and RNA.
- **Random Sequence Generation**: Create random DNA or RNA sequences with customizable GC content and length.
- **Base Counting**: Count the occurrence of each base (A, T/U, C, G) in a sequence.
- **TUI Interface**: Interact with the program through a terminal-based user interface for ease of use.

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WolfTech-Innovations/AlphaBIO.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd AlphaBIO
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage:
To run the program:
```bash
python AlphaBIO.py
```

You will be presented with an interactive menu where you can choose your sequence type (DNA or RNA) and perform various operations like mutation, transcription, reverse complement, and more.

### Example:
1. Select your sequence type (DNA or RNA).
2. Enter your sequence.
3. Choose an operation like transcribing DNA to RNA, introducing a mutation, or generating a random sequence.
4. View or save your results.
